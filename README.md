# ExtractiveSummFLAN-T5
An extractive summarization project using FLAN-T5, tailored to select key sentences from input texts.

ExtractiveSummFLAN-T5 is an NLP project that leverages the FLAN-T5 model for extractive summarization tasks. Unlike traditional abstractive summarization, this approach focuses on selecting the most important sentences directly from the source text. It's particularly useful for domains where preserving the original sentence structure is crucial, such as legal documents, news articles, or technical reports.
